        <h2><strong>EXISTING IN THE ADDERALL ZONE</strong></h2>
<p>The Adderall Zone refers to a long period of time in which an individual was on the prescribed amphetamine such as Adderall.</p>
<p>This could be through childhood, young adulthood, or even adulthood.</p>
<p>The fact is, <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/?s=Adderall">Adderall</a> is a drug that can be prescribed to anyone at any time in their life.</p>
<p>The irony about this is while we remain dependent on Adderall for its ability to make us focus on the tasks we have to complete, whether they be school or work related, Adderall as a drug stays the same.</p>
<p>Adderall doesn&rsquo;t equate for a person&rsquo;s age or how strong or mild a case of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or narcolepsy they may have, which is what the drug treats.</p>
<p>Another consistency that Adderall possess is a very serious ability to be addictive. Consequentially, if one has been using Adderall since high school, but is now past college and working in a career while still using Adderall, there is a very strong chance they are addicted to the drug.</p>
<h2><strong>HOW TO HELP YOURSELF OUT OF THE ADDERALL ZONE</strong></h2>
<p>Granted, <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/services/detox">detoxing</a> and recovering from Adderall addiction is a dicey endeavor to take on, especially by one&rsquo;s self.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Adderall withdrawal include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fatigue which is the most common and immediate side effect from Adderall withdrawal is a feeling of being tired or fatigued all the time</li>
  <li>Depression</li>
  <li>Sleep Disorders</li>
  <li>Mental Confusion</li>
  <li>Increased Hunger</li>
  <li>Anxiety</li>
  <li>Irritability</li>
  <li>Lucid Dreams</li>
  <li>Panic Attacks</li>
  <li>Loss of Libido</li>
  <li>Disconnectedness </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask yourself if you can handle these withdrawal symptoms on your own. Be truthful, because in some instances, a number of these symptoms have been known to put those seeking recovery in danger, and even lead to death.</p>
<h2><strong>SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP</strong></h2>
<p>If you do feel it&rsquo;s time for you to kick your Adderall habit, look into a certified detox and <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/what-do-you-do-in-rehab">rehabilitation center</a> which offers clinical help for those who suffer the same malady.</p>
<p>Professional help will ensure a safe recovery process, whether it be in or out patient recovery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to let the old habits of your youth leave you. If you feel Adderall has begun to take its toll, start the rehab process now to begin your new, substance-free life.</p>
